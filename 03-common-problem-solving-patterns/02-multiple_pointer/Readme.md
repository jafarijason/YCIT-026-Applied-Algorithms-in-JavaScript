# [Multiple Pointers](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-the-multiple-pointers-strategy-to-solve-algorithms-b90a98f854db)

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain condition.

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well



## Example
```JavaScript
// Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers.
// The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0.
// Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if pair does not exist.

// someZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]); // [-3, 3]
// someZero([-2, 0, 1, 3]); // undefined
// someZero([1, 2, 3]); // undefined

```
