## What is Recursion?

A <strong>Process</strong> (a function) that <strong>calls itself</strong>

## Why Use Recursion?
<ul>
    <li>It is Everywhere!</li>
    <li>JSON.parse/JSON.stringify</li>
    <li>document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms</li>
    <li>Object traversal</li>
    <li>Sometimes it is cleaner alternative to iteration</li>
</ul>

## Call Stack

In almost all program languages, there is a built in data structure that manage what happens when functions are invoked.

Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of call stack.

When Javascript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)
